# Contributing

Issues are welcome, either for identifying bugs or requesting features as long
as they make sense considering the scope of the project and the feasibility of
its implementation on the different _flavors_.

If you'd like to suggest a new _flavor_ to add to this project, you are also
welcome to create an issue for it. An example (or PR) is also appreciated
instead of or along with the issue.
